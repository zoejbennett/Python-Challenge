# Python-Challenge
## PyBank and PyPoll exercises demonstrate use of Visual Studio Code in order to calculate financial and political analyses.

Mainbank.py utilizes data from the PyBank resources comparing dates with profit changes. From this data, I calculated the total months and profit of the overall dataset, as well as the total change, average change, greatest increase and greatest loss of profit throughout the data.

Mainpypoll.py uses the data collected from approximately 370,000 votes cast to determine an exact vote count, as well as the percent and counted votes for the three candidates. Finally, the code announces the winner of the vote.

Throughout this code, I had help from EdX tutor Kourt Bailey as well as stack overflow for further help.
